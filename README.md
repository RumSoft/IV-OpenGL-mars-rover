# IV - Computer Graphics in OpenGL - Mars rover

This readme is outdated a little

This is `GTA VI: Mars` project. Mars rover driving on Mars surface, that's all.

The project contains pure openGL code (no additional libraries, only 
gl.h/glu.h (yeah, painful, but that was the requirement)).

Features
* everything is object (shape or geom)
* updateable shape/geom
* pre/post render methods
* basic physics for objects some object
* OBJ file importing
* all normals seems to be flipped (needs fix)
* input handler
* smooth camera
* particle system
* ground alignment
  
Quat/Vec3/Vec2/M33 libraries are copied.
